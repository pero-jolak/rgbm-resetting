# Code to numerically simulate reallocating GBM with resetting

This repository includes:

Python code for simulation of trajectories used in: "Impact of stochastic resetting on resource
allocation: The case of Reallocating geometric Brownian
motion". published in Physical Review E: https://journals.aps.org/pre/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevE.111.034129

RGBM with resetting.py - simulate RGBM with resetting trajectories

and the data and code for plotting the figures from the same paper, organized in separate folders.
